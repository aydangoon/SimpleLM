#How to Use TextureSwapper

To dump textures run the program and hit "Dump Textures" on the first prompt. <br />
The output window will tell you all relevant information you may want to know. <br />

To add textures, first make sure you have a texture editor that can modify .dds files. A good cross platform program I would recommend is <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> <br />
Take one of the texture you've dumped and edit it in a texture editing software. <br />
Export this new texture with DXT1 compression (GIMP will have an option for this when you export the image.) <br />
Then run the program and hit "Add Texture" on the first prompt. <br />
The output window will tell you all relevant information you may want to know. <br />
